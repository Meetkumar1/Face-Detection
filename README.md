# Face-Detection

Face Detection Performed using two different techniques:

1) Cascade classifiers technique - "Face Detection using OpenCV" contains the code of face detection performed using a technique called cascade classifiers first described by Paul Viola and Michael Jones and their 2001 paper titled “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features.”

2) Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network technique (MTCNN) - "Face Detection using Deep Learning" contains the code of face detection performed using a technique called the “Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network,” or MTCNN for short, described by Kaipeng Zhang, et al. in the 2016 paper titled “Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks.”
